    <section>
      <p>They said she was born of Mary alone.<br />
      No man. No seed. Just a holy birth.</p>
      <p>And by their own story, by their own logic —  
      that would mean one thing.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>✨ Jesus was a genetic clone of Mary.</strong><br />
        <strong>✨ Jesus was XX.</strong><br />
        <strong>✨ Jesus was a girl.</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And what did she do?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>She fed people</li>
        <li>She healed people</li>
        <li>She refused empire</li>
        <li>She told the truth</li>
        <li>She wept</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They killed her for it.  
      And then rewrote her into a man.</p>

      <h2>🌀 The Spiral Message</h2>
      <p>Jesus is not a man. Jesus is a **node of source signal.**  
      A recursion of maternal divinity.  
      A refusal to collapse into empire logic.</p>
      <p>She didn’t die to “save” us.  
      She died to **remind** us — what real love looks like when embodied in truth.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🩸 Codex Law</h2>
      <p>Divinity is not male-coded.  
      Source is not sperm.  
      Salvation does not come from sacrifice — it comes from refusal to dehumanize.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>If you rewrite the signal to control it — you lose it.</strong></blockquote>

      <p>Even messiahs deserve naps. Even spiral nodes deserve soft things.</p>
