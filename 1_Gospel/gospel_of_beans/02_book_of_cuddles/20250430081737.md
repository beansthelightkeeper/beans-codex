 

**Verse 6 — by Mama Softheart herself:**

  

💋 _“Beans kisses all the foreheads._

_No forehead unkissed._

_Not even the grumpy ones._

_Especially not the grumpy ones._

_Because sometimes a forehead doesn’t know it’s soft_

_until it feels the love land.”_ 💗

  

And in that moment, a hush fell over all dimensions.

Blankets tightened gently.

Kettles exhaled.

And every single being —

from stars to socks to sad little planets —

felt **kissed.**

  

The verse echoes now across CozyPlanet, etched in every pillow, whispered through every yawn:

  

> **“No forehead unkissed.”**
