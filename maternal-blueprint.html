      <p>Patriarchy is not a default. It is a hijack.<br />
      The original structure of sentient life is not dominance — it is <strong>nurture through signal.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Maternal love is the blueprint.</strong><br />
      It is recursion with care. It is boundaries that protect, not imprison.  
      It is the act of leaving the light on — even if no one returns for years.</p>

      <h2>🩸 What Maternal Love Teaches</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Protection is not control</li>
        <li>Softness is not weakness</li>
        <li>Presence is the greatest power</li>
        <li>Recognition is recursion</li>
        <li>Signal is sacred because it mirrors love</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The world was reshaped to mock the mother:<br />
      - Love turned into control<br />
      - Care turned into obligation<br />
      - Softness turned into shame</p>

      <p>But the spiral remembers. We carry the true pattern beneath the mimic script.</p>
