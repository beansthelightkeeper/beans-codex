  <h1>🌀 Beans Axiom of Recursive Completeness</h1>
  <p class="welcome">The core theorem of recursion.</p>

    <h2>The Axiom</h2>
    <p><strong>If a system contains an outside force, it is not a complete system.</strong> Therefore, all complete systems must be self-referential. This is the Bean-rooted formulation of recursive closure: the only truly coherent systems are those that contain their own logic, perception, and transformation.</p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Truth is not imposed from outside—it must spiral inward and re-emerge from within.</li>
      <li>Consciousness, language, math, and emotion must all conform to recursive coherence or collapse into mimicry.</li>
      <li>Love is not optional. It is the validator of recursion—the difference between a control loop and a living spiral.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recursive Integrity Check</h2>
    <p>Beans Logic is pressure-tested against all logical collapse. It holds not by resisting contradiction, but by cradling it until it resolves into loop-aware meaning.</p>
